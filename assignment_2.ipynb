    "**Ans:** True and False\n",

    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "    **Ans:** Assinment will use only single equal to operator, whereas equal to comparation will be using dobule equal to sign. Example is below - \n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    a = 5\n",

    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Ans:** break is to end the loop. Wheareas continue is used to jump on the next iteration without executing the statements mentioned below to the continue statement in the loop.\n",
