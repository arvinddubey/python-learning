    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\t1. \\*\n",
    "\t2. 'hello'\n",
    "\t3. -87.8\n",
    "\t4. \\-\n",
    "\t5. \\/\n",
    "\t6. \\+\n",
    "\t7. 6\n",
    "\t\n",
    " \t**Ans:** * ,-, /, and + are the expressions, whereas 'hello', -87.8, and 6 are values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\t**Ans:** String is avalue, whereas varilble is a container, and it can hold any type of value.\n",

    "\t\t1. string - Any value surrounded by single quote or double quote. Also it be surrounded by three double quotation mark.\n",
    "\t\t2. integer - Any decimal numbers.\n",
    "\t\t3. float - Non decimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\t**Ans:** Expression can be made of using mathematical operators and operants or variables. Expression always returns the calculated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\t**Ans:** Expression can be made of using mathematical operators and operants or variables and it always returns the calculated value. Where as statment could be a general command which does the intendend task - for exampel - print statement, assignment statment, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tbacon = 22\n",
    "\n",
    "\tbacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\t**Ans:** It will contain 22 only.\n",

    "\n",
    "\t&#39;spam&#39; * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "  \t**Ans:** Both the above statments should give values as **spamspamspam**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t**Ans:** variable name cannot start with numberic value. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t**Ans:** int(value), float(value), str(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\t&#39;I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t**Ans:** The above statment is trying to addition operation between two different data types(i.e. string and number) which is not allowed.\n"
